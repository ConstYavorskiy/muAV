A palm size open source quadrotor research platform


Motivation:

The aim of the micro quadrotor project is to provide a lightweight (approximately 86g) and cheap robotic research platform that can be used for a range of robotic applications. One possible application could be a cheap test bed for robotic swarm research. This project was created to start an open source PCB only quadrotor for research applications. The idea was to create the simplest PCB only design in which all hardware is integrated. The hardware was selected to be state of the art allowing the system to be fully autonomous and used in high level research applications. Applications could include low cost robotic swarms or search and rescue in constrained environments.
